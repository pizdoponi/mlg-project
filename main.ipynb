    "1. Apply noise to the training to mitigate error accumulation over long rollouts. We use a simple approach to make the model more robust to noisy inputs: at training we corrupt the input velocities of the model with random-walk noise N (0, $\\sigma_v$ = 0.0003) (adjusting input positions), so the training distribution is closer to the distribution generated during rollouts. \n",
    "2. Normalize all input and target vectors elementwise to zero mean and unit variance, using statistics computed online during training. Preliminary experiments showed that normalization led to faster training, though converged performance was not noticeably improved."
